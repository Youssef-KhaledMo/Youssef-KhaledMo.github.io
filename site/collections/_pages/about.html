      <p>Hello! I'm Youssef Khaled Mohamed, a passionate <strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong> 
      with a strong foundation in AI, Embedded Systems, and Software Development. I recently graduated 
      with a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from Helwan University, where I earned an overall rating 
      of 'Very Good'.</p>

      <p>During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to develop the 
      <strong>Enhanced DriveGuard (EDG) System</strong>, an innovative safety solution designed to 
      enhance driving safety by mitigating human error. My project was recognized for its excellence, 
      securing <strong>1st place in the "Made in Egypt" (MIE) competition</strong> among over 300 projects, 
      and <strong>3rd place in the Valeo mentorship program</strong> out of 511 projects.</p>

      <p>I specialize in creating intelligent systems using <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and 
      <strong>Embedded Systems</strong>, with experience in developing applications that range from 
      safety solutions to interactive voice assistants. My technical expertise includes proficiency in 
      <strong>Python, C++, Java, and Embedded C</strong>, as well as frameworks like <strong>TensorFlow, 
      Scikit-Learn, and OpenCV</strong>.</p>

      <p>I am currently advancing my skills further through the <strong>Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)</strong> 
      on the Machine Learning track, where I continue to explore new technologies and develop cutting-edge 
      solutions.</p>

      <p>Feel free to explore my projects, learn more about my journey, or get in touch if you're 
      interested in collaboration or have any questions!</p>
